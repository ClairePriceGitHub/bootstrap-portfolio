# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

Project completed to utilise Bootstrap framework in creating a portfolio website to showcase personal project work as it is completed. The portfolio will be beneficial for job applications and other circumstances where I need to provide an overview of web applications I have created, in an efficient and visually pleasing manner, whilst also demonstrating my ability to use the Bootstrap framework.

Bootstrap elements were used to quickly create the initial structure and then manipulated for personalisation. I experimented with these elements to see how I could produce a creative design. 

The project initially uses placeholder images and text for work examples and the skills sections, to be replaced as I complete projects. 

On completion of this project my knowledge of the Bootstrap framework has developed and I am aware of how to use and edit Bootstrap elements. I have produced a personal portfolio unique to me, intended to convey technicality and creativity.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Navigation bar links to sections with different information within the page. Placeholder project images are setup with links, ready to be modified, as future projects are completed. Links to email (currently set as placeholder), GitHub repository and Linkedin profile open in a new tab.
